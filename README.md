## 🖥️ Deployment / Live Demo

* The project is deployed as a static site — just build and push to GitHub Pages
* Example using GitHub Pages:

1. Build the app:

   npm run build

2. Push the build output to the branch configured for Pages (e.g. gh-pages)

## ✅ Usage Instructions (How to Play)

* Open the app. A 3×3 grid will appear.
* Players take turns clicking on empty cells to mark either **X** or **O**.
* Once a player lines up three marks in a row/column/diagonal — the game declares a winner.
* If all cells are filled without a winner — the game is a draw.
* (Optional) Add a “Restart” or “Play Again” button to reset the board.
